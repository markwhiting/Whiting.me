## Frequently asked questions

### Meetings

I am trying to reduce meetings, so if we don't already have a scheduled meeting, please first [email me](mailto:mark@whiting.me) your question, including a phone number at which I can reach you. I generally prefer to respond via email, but if it makes more sense, I'll call or find a time to meet.

### Reccomendation letters and references

I am eager to support the careers of my research students, interns and colleagues with letters or references. In general, 2 weeks before the application deadline, [email me](mailto:mark@whiting.me?subject=Reference request) the details of the application, my letter deadline, your application essays, your CV and an informal paragraph about our work together — use this to let me know if there's anything you'd like me to highlight. 

If the deadline is closer than 2 weeks, ask if I'm able to do it — I'll let you know if I have the flexibility to write a letter in that time.

I'll email you when I submit the letter, but if you don't hear from me by the day before the deadline, feel free to send lots of angry messages.

It's fine to ask me what I will say about you. If there is any chance my letter could be seen as negative or surprising, I will let you know before I write it, so that you can decide if you would rather I don't submit on your behalf.
