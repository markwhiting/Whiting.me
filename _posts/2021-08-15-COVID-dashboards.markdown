Together with [Duncan Watts](https://css.seas.upenn.edu/people/duncan-watts/) and others on the team at the [CSSLab](https://css.seas.upenn.edu) at Penn, and in conjunction with the city of Philadelphia, we built a collection of interactive data dashboards that visually summarize human mobility patterns over time and space for a number of cities, starting with Philadelphia, along with highlighting potentially relevant demographic correlates. The dashboards are available at [covid.seas.upenn.edu](https://covid.seas.upenn.edu).

The dashboards are built in [Observable](https://observablehq.com/collection/@wattslab/covid-dashboards). The data are a proprietary combination of cell phone GPS data, demographic data derived from the American Community Survey, and COVID-19 caseload data from the New York Times.
